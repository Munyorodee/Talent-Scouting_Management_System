[Mufaro David Munyoro](https://munyorodee.github.io/Talent-Scouting_Management_System) is a web application that is designed to allow disadvantaged and talented youths to have an equal opportunity to showcase their talent to the World. This is specifically designed for
the Zimbabwean context.
To achieve this goal, the system will allow all interested Zimbabweans to upload their profile including video snippets and playing attributes in their designated age cohort to allow Club scouts to quickly identify talent.

## Future

There are plenty of features that we would love to implement into TalentScout Zw.
Adding more APIs (which mostly require approval) 
Work is also being put into making
the view and formatting better and also touches need to be done on Club joining feature. Along with this, adding more features to keep users motivated and engaged such as alerts and notifications as well as more functionalities for admin users are currently being worked on. 
Also, workmis being prepared to add on machine learning algorithms to easily give a player average rating for easy identification and also player success probability calculation.
On player attributes, new categories are going to be added to make the web application more professional.

If you have any suggestions or would like to contribute to TalentScout Zw, please contact either of us.
